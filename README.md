## Objective
Create a Book Inventory Management API using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL to perform CRUD operations on book data.

## Task Description

* Set up a Node.js project with Express.js and PostgreSQL.
  * Initialize a new Node.js project using npm or yarn.
  * Install the necessary dependencies such as Express.js and the PostgreSQL library (pg).
  * Set up a basic Express.js server.
* Create a PostgreSQL database and set up the necessary tables.
  * Using the psql command-line utility or a database management tool like DBeaver or pgAdmin, create a new PostgreSQL database for the book inventory management.
  * Design the necessary tables to store book data. For example, you can have a table named books with columns such as id, title, author, genre, and quantity. Be mindful of the data types and constraints when creating the tables.
* Implement the API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on books.
  * Set up the necessary Express.js routes and handlers to handle CRUD operations.
  * Create a route to retrieve all books from the database (GET /books).
  * Create a route to retrieve a specific book by ID from the database (GET /books/:id).
  * Create a route to add a new book to the database (POST /books).
  * Create a route to update a book by ID in the database (PATCH /books/:id).
  * Create a route to delete a book by ID from the database (DELETE /books/:id).
  * Use SQL queries to interact with the PostgreSQL database and perform the necessary CRUD operations.
* Test the API endpoints using Postman.
  * Use Postman or any API testing tool to send requests to the API endpoints. (add screenshots in the repo README of your sucessful API calls)
  * Test each endpoint (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) with different scenarios to ensure they function correctly.
  * Verify that the API endpoints are correctly interacting with the PostgreSQL database and returning the expected results.
